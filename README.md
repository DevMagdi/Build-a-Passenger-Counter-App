# Build-a-Passenger-Counter-App
Automated Passenger Counters (APC) are essentially dual people counting sensors that count the in and out numbers and are installed on transit vehicles. APCs accurately and automatically count and log the numbers of people on buses, trains, rail networks, ships, etc., as they get on and off at each stop or station.
